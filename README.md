## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

> **A Note on System UI Integration:** To ensure a clean and predictable experience, NetSpeedTray is designed to integrate seamlessly with core Windows UI. Due to how Windows layers its system menus, elements like the Start Menu and Action Center will always appear on top.
>
> Instead of being awkwardly covered, the widget will gracefully hide when these menus are active and **reappear instantly** the moment they are closed. This behavior is intentional and ensures the widget feels like a polished, non-intrusive part of the operating system.
