## [1.0.9] - August 4, 2025

This is a major stability, performance, and quality-of-life update focused on refining the widget's core behavior, improving data accuracy, and optimizing the application's architecture for future features.

### ‚ú® Major Improvements

- ** Improved Widget Stability & Behavior:** The widget now feels much more like a native part of the Windows taskbar. An entirely new, event-driven architecture (using a WinEventHook and a safety-net timer) has been implemented to intelligently manage visibility.
  The widget no longer flickers, disappears, or gets stuck behind the taskbar when interacting with the Calendar, Network/Volume flyouts, or the tray overflow menu.

- **Enhanced Startup Performance:** The application's impact on system startup has been reduced. By implementing "lazy loading" for the graph window and other UI components, the initial launch is now faster and lighter on system resources.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Refinements

- **Graphing Engine Overhaul:** The graph window's data pipeline has been completely revised for accuracy and reliability.
  - Fixed a critical bug that caused the graph to appear flat-lined or empty due to a data unit mismatch in the database.
  - Corrected the "Total" data calculation in the stats bar, which was showing vastly inflated numbers.
  - Fixed an issue where the "Live Update" toggle was not updating the graph in real-time.
- **Accurate Speed Calculation:** Resolved a bug where network speeds could show an incorrect, massive spike after the computer wakes from sleep or hibernation.
- **Application Stability:**
  - Fixed a potential crash (`AttributeError`) that could occur when closing the application.
  - Hardened the DPI detection logic to prevent log spam and errors from invalid monitor handles reported by the OS.
- **Code Quality & Architecture:**
  - The core data management model has been centralized into a single `WidgetState` class, improving clarity and retiring the redundant `SpeedHistory` class.
  - The developer console is now clean, with benign `matplotlib` warnings on first launch being properly handled.
  - Numerous unused imports and obsolete code paths have been removed.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note for Existing Users

- To enable the data accuracy fixes, **users upgrading from a previous version must delete their old history database.** A new, clean database will be created automatically.
- **Instructions:**
  1.  Ensure NetSpeedTray is not running.
  2.  Open File Explorer, paste `%APPDATA%\NetSpeedTray` into the address bar, and press Enter.
  3.  Delete the file named `speed_history.db`.

## [1.0.8] - July 31, 2025

This release focuses on improving the reliability and accuracy of the Network Speed Graph, resolving all known bugs related to data display and state persistence.

### ‚ú® Graph Window Improvements

- **Accurate "System Uptime" Timeline:** The "System Uptime" view now correctly uses the system's actual boot time as its starting point, perfectly matching the behavior of the Windows Task Manager.
- **Correct "Session" Timeline:** The "Session" view is now persistent and correctly displays data from the start of the application, regardless of how many times the graph window is opened or closed.
- **Accurate Statistics Bar:** The "Max" and "Total" statistics displayed at the top of the graph are now always calculated correctly based on the selected timeline, ensuring you see the right data for the right period.
- **Improved Initial Load:** Fixed a bug where the graph would sometimes show "No data available" on its first launch, even when historical data was present. It now reliably displays the correct timeline from the moment it opens.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Refinements

- **Build Process:** The build script has been made more robust.
- **Configuration:** The application's configuration file now officially recognizes and validates all graph-related settings, eliminating harmless but noisy warning messages from the log files.

## [1.0.7] - July 30, 2025

This is a landmark stability release that perfects the core user experience of the widget. Through a comprehensive overhaul of the positioning and state management logic, the widget now behaves with the rock-solid predictability of a native Windows UI element. All visual "flickering," "jumping," and "drifting" issues have been eliminated.

### ‚ú® Core Experience & Stability Overhaul

- **Perfectly Stable Positioning:** Resolved a complex series of deep-seated bugs that caused the widget to flicker or jump. The widget's position is now completely stable during application startup, after closing the settings window, and while the system tray icons change.
- **Smooth & Intuitive Dragging:** The widget no longer "fights" the user's cursor or snaps to a slightly different spot after being moved. The position where you release the mouse is now its final, pixel-perfect location.
- **Intelligent Snap-to-Edge:** When dragging the widget near the system tray, it now intelligently snaps to a minimum safe distance if moved too far, gracefully respecting the user's intent to place it as close as possible.
- **Unrestricted Placement:** The arbitrary limit on how far the widget could be dragged along the taskbar has been removed. Placement is now constrained only by the edges of your screen.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Refinements

- **Graph Window:** Fixed a critical `AttributeError` that could prevent the Graph Window from opening correctly.
- **Configuration File:** The app's config file is now cleaner and no longer stores unnecessary `position_x` and `position_y` fields when they are not in use.
- **UI Text:** The "Enable Free Move" label in settings has been simplified to "Free Move (No Snapping)" for better clarity.

---

## [1.0.6] - July 29, 2025

This release focused on quality-of-life improvements, introducing the initial version of the adaptive widget positioning and overhauling the installation process for seamless future updates.

#### ‚ú® Added

- **Adaptive Positioning (Beta):**
  - The widget now learns and maintains your preferred distance from the system tray.
  - It automatically shifts its position to prevent being overlapped by new application icons appearing in the tray.
  - Your custom spacing is "learned" simply by dragging the widget while _Free Move_ is disabled.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Improved

- **Seamless Upgrades & WinGet Compatibility:** The Windows installer has been overhauled. It now correctly replaces the previous version's files, ensuring a clean and reliable upgrade experience. This change also prepares the application for distribution via the Windows Package Manager (WinGet).
- **UI Clarity:** Renamed the confusing "Smart Threshold" toggle to **"Dynamic Update Rate"** to more accurately describe its power-saving function.
- **User-Friendly File Naming:** The configuration and log files have been renamed to be more descriptive (`NetSpeedTray_Config.json` and `NetSpeedTray_Log.log`), making them easier for users to identify.

---

## [1.0.5] - July 29, 2025

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Free Move is Here!**

  - You can now unlock the widget from the taskbar and place it **anywhere on your screen**.
  - The widget's position is automatically saved when Free Move is enabled and it reliably snaps back to its default location when disabled.

- **Total Control Over Speed Units:**
  - A new **Speed Units** panel has been added to the settings for granular control over the text display.
  - **Display Mode:** Choose between 'Auto' scaling (bps, Kbps, Mbps) and 'Always Mbps'.
  - **Decimal Places:** Set the speed value precision from 0 to 2 decimal places.
  - **Text Alignment:** Align the speed text left, center, or right within the widget.
  - **Force Decimals:** A new option to always show decimal points (e.g., `5.0` instead of `5`).

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements & Refinements

- **Smarter Installer:** The Windows installer now automatically replaces the old executable, ensuring a clean and seamless upgrade experience. Old version files are removed.
- **Improved Configuration:** The configuration file has been renamed to `NetSpeedTray_Config.json` for clarity. The management system is now more robust, preventing settings from being accidentally discarded.
- **Cleaner Log Files:** The log file has been unified and renamed to `NetSpeedTray_Log.log` to make troubleshooting easier.
- **Accurate Graph Stats:** The statistics in the main graph's status bar are now calculated correctly for all timelines, including "All".

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Mini-Graph Now Renders Correctly:** Fixed a series of silent failures that were preventing the mini-graph from appearing on the widget. This was the most significant bug from the beta and is now fully resolved.
- **CRITICAL: State Persistence Fixed:** Resolved a major bug where toggle states (like **Free Move**, **Force Decimals**, and **Start with Windows**) were not being saved correctly across application restarts.
- **"Snap-Back" Bug Fixed:** Corrected a state management flaw where disabling "Free Move" sometimes required clicking "Save" twice. The widget now snaps back to its default position instantly and reliably on the first click.

## [1.0.3] - March 1, 2025

### Bug Fixes

- **Startup Positioning Issue**: Resolved the issue where the `Widget` jumps to the top-left corner on startup after login, ensuring it maintains its exact saved position immediately.
- **Desktop Click Hiding/Flashing**: Fixed the issue where clicking the desktop causes the widget to hide and "flash", improving fullscreen detection and adding debouncing to prevent rapid visibility toggles.
- **Portable Startup Issue**: Fixed the "Start with Windows" option in the portable version, ensuring it creates a shortcut in the Startup folder for automatic launch on login, matching installed version behavior (requires `pywin32` for shortcut creation).

### Enhancements

- **Improved Widget Visibility and Z-Order Management**
  - Enhanced the widget‚Äôs visibility handling to ensure the widget remains visible across window switches and taskbar interactions.
- **Optimized Settings Dialog Positioning**
  - Streamlined the positioning of the settings dialog to use Qt‚Äôs screen geometry, ensuring it remains fully visible above the taskbar in multi-monitor setups, with better handling of size changes after saving settings.

### Known Issues

- **Start Menu Interaction Issue**

  - The `Widget` may hide or become unresponsive when the Windows Start menu is opened, This issue arises due to a Windows limitation where `Shell_TrayWnd` (the taskbar window) and related UI elements (e.g., Start menu) can obscure or temporarily disable overlay windows - like the widget.
  - Windows does not provide a reliable API or event to distinguish Start menu activation from other fullscreen or taskbar-related states, leading to potential misdetection in `is_fullscreen_app_active` or `check_and_update`. This behavior is outside NetSpeedTray‚Äôs control but may be mitigated in future updates by enhancing taskbar and Start menu state tracking.
  - What this all means to the avarage user - when clicking on the start menu, the widget 'hides' and when clicking anywhere other than the taskbar, it will reappear

  ### Detailed Bug Fixes (for those interested)

- **Enhanced Position Persistence**
  - Modified `NetworkSpeedWidget.initialize_with_saved_position` and `use_saved_position` to prioritize loading and applying the last saved position (`position_x`, `position_y`) from `netspeedtray.conf` on startup, ensuring the widget appears exactly where the user left it after each Windows logon.
  - Updated `update_position` to check for the `initial_position_set` flag and saved coordinates, defaulting to the last saved position unless explicitly overridden by dragging or major failures.
  - Improved error handling in `use_saved_position` and `update_position` to only fall back to position (100, 100) if there‚Äôs a critical failure (e.g., `taskbar_hwnd` or screen geometry cannot be detected). This prevents unnecessary repositioning to the top-left corner.
- **"Flashing" Prevention**:
  - Delayed widget visibility (`self.show()`) until `initialize_with_saved_position` confirms the correct position, avoiding premature display in the wrong location. This eliminates the "flashing" by ensuring smooth positioning before rendering.
  - Added logging in `initialize_with_saved_position` and `use_saved_position` to debug positioning issues, ensuring visibility of any errors causing the "flash" or incorrect placement.
- **Configuration Validation**:
  - Enhanced `load_config` and `validate_config` to ensure `position_x` and `position_y` are integers and within valid screen bounds, preventing corrupted or invalid position data from causing positioning errors.

## [1.0.2] - February 26, 2025

### Added

- **Startup Synchronization** Added command-line arguments (`--set-startup`, `--unset-startup`) to sync "Start with Windows" between the installer and app settings.

### Bugs Fixes

- **Invisible Widget Issue**: Resolved the issue where the app runs but the `Widget` remains invisible, ensuring proper display on the taskbar after launch, even after system restarts or environment changes (e.g., multi-monitor setups, fullscreen apps).
- **Dragging Error**:
  -Fixed and improving mouse event handling.

### Known Limitations

- **Multi-Monitor Support**
  - Supports multi-monitor setups by detecting the taskbar screen, but may experience positioning or sizing issues if monitors have different DPI scaling levels (e.g., 125%, 150%, 200%, 300%).
  - Handles resolution mismatches between monitors, but scaling mismatches can cause issues.
- **KVM Switches**
  - Should return to the correct position after switching via a KVM, but temporary mispositioning or scaling issues may occur if the new monitor setup differs (resolution, scaling, taskbar position).
- **Start Menu Interaction Issue**
  - The `Widget` may hide or become unresponsive when the Windows Start menu is opened, particularly on multi-monitor setups or with custom taskbar configurations. This issue arises due to a Windows limitation where `Shell_TrayWnd` (the taskbar window) and related UI elements (e.g., Start menu) can obscure or temporarily disable overlay windows like the widget.
  - Windows does not provide a reliable API or event to distinguish Start menu activation from other fullscreen or taskbar-related states, leading to potential misdetection in `is_fullscreen_app_active` or `check_and_update`. This behavior is outside NetSpeedTray‚Äôs control but may be mitigated in future updates by enhancing taskbar and Start menu state tracking.
  - Functionally - when clicking on the start menu, the widget 'hides' and when clicking anywhere but on the taskbar, it will reappear
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Multiple or docked taskbars, monitor hot-plugging, high DPI scaling on small monitors, fullscreen apps on non-taskbar monitors, low-performance systems, KVM switches to non-Windows OS, and custom taskbar positions may cause issues or misbehavior.

### Future Improvements

- Enhanced multi-monitor support with per-monitor DPI scaling awareness.
- Robust handling of KVM switches, monitor hot-plugging, and custom taskbar positions.
- Performance optimizations for low-end systems.
